# ModelBuilder
A library for easy generation of model classes

## Creating a model
The Model class is a static class that is the easiest way to generator models

```
var model = Model.Create<Person>();
```

This supports creating new instances of classes, nested classes and populating variables out of the box. It will also support providing constructor arguments to the top level type being created.

```
var model = Model.CreateWith<Person>("Fred", "Smith");
```

You may want to create a model that ignores setting a property for a specific construction.

```
var model = Model.Ignoring<Person>(x => x.FirstName).Create<Person>();
```

Ignoring a property can also be configured for types that may exist deep in an inheritance hierarchy for the type being created.

```
var model = Model.Ignoring<Address>(x => x.AddressLine1).Create<Person>();
```

Do you already have an instance that perhaps you didn't create? That is ok too.

```
var person = new Person
{
    FirstName = "Jane"
};

var model = Model.Ignoring<Person>(x => x.FirstName).Populate<Person>();

var customer = new Person();

var customerModel = Model.Populate(customer);
```

## Changing the model after creation

Sometimes you need to tweak a model after it has been created. This can be done easily using the Set extension method on any object.

```
var person = Model.Create<Person>().Set(x => x.FirstName = "Joe").Set(x => x.Email = null);

var otherPerson = Model.Create<Person>().Set(x => 
    {
        x.FirstName = "Joe";
        x.Email = null;
    });
```

This is nice for simple properties, but assigning values across an enumerable set of data is important. We've got that covered too.

```
var organisation = Model.Create<Organisation>();

organisation.Staff.SetEach(x => x.Email = null);
```

## Customizing the process

ModelBuilder is designed with extensibility in mind. There are many ways that the process of building models can be customized. The extensibility points are:

- TypeCreators
- ValueGenerators
- CreationRules
- IgnoreRules
- ExecuteOrderRules
- ConstructorResolver

ModelBuilder uses a BuildStrategy that defines this configuration and is the source of all model creation requests.

### BuildStrategy and ExecuteStrategy
ModelBuilder uses two layers for assisting in creating instances of models, the BuildStrategy and the ExecutionStrategy. They both hold references to the same construction configuration but have different purposes.

A BuildStrategy is a higher level construct that provides a read-only view of the construction configuration. It exposes a method for getting an instance of IExecutionStrategy&lt;T&gt;. The purpose here is that code calling ModelBuilder should have a clear understanding of how a model is constructed via the configuration items. The BuildStrategy enforces this by being a read-only source of that configuration.

You can create a custom BuildStrategy from scratch by creating your own type that implements IBuildStrategy. You can also assign this instance as the default BuildStrategy against Model.

```
Model.BuildStrategy = new CustomBuildStrategy();
```

Most often you will want to enhance the existing build strategy. This can be done by cloning, customizing and compiling a new build strategy.

```
var strategy = ModelBuilder.DefaultBuildStrategy
    .Clone()
    .AddTypeCreator<MyCustomTypeCreator>()
    .AddValueGenerator<MyCustomValueGenerator>()
	.AddCreationRule<Person>(x => x.IsAdministrator, false)
    .AddIgnoreRule<Person>(x => x.FirstName)
    .AddExecuteOrderRule<Person>(x => x.LastName, 10)
    .Compile();

Model.BuildStrategy = strategy;
```

You may want to create multiple build strategies that support different model constructor designs. These can be used on the fly as well.

```
var model = Model.Using<CustomBuildStrategy>().Create<Person>();
```

### Type creators

Type creators are used to create instances of classes, or reference types with the exception of System.String. There are two type creators that ModelBuilder provides out of the box. DefaultTypeCreator and EnumerableTypeCreator.

DefaultTypeCreator will create a new instance of a type using Activator.CreateInstance and supports the optional provision of constructor arguments.

EnumerableTypeCreate will create instances of most types derived from IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;. It will also attempt to populate the instance with data.

### Value generators

Value generators are used to create value types. There are many value generators that come out of the box. These are:

- AddressValueGenerator
- AgeValueGenerator
- BooleanValueGenerator
- CityValueGenerator
- CompanyValueGenerator
- CountryValueGenerator
- CountValueGenerator
- DateOfBirthValueGenerator
- DateTimeValueGenerator
- DomainNameValueGenerator
- EmailValueGenerator
- EnumValueGenerator
- FirstNameValueGenerator
- GenderValueGenerator
- GuidValueGenerator
- IPAddressValueGenerator
- LastNameValueGenerator
- NumericValueGenerator
- PhoneValueGenerator
- PostCodeValueGenerator
- StateValueGenerator
- StringValueGenerator
- SuburbValueGenerator
- TimeZoneValueGenerator
- UriValueGenerator

Some of these generators create values using random data (string, guid, numbers etc). Entity type properties (names, addresses etc) use an embedded resource of 2,000 records as the data source to then pick pseudo-random information to provide better quality values.

### Creation rules

Creation rules are simple rules that bypass creating values using an IValueGenerator or an ITypeCreator. Most often they are used when creating a custom IBuildStrategy via BuildStrategyCompiler. Implementing a custom IValueGenerator or ITypeCreator is the preferred method if more complexity is required than simple creation rules (such as always making a property on a type a static value).

### Ignore rules

You may have a model with a property that you do not want to have a value generated for it. This can be done with an IgnoreRule.

### Execute order rules

Generating random or pseudo-random data for a model dynamically is never going to be perfect. We can however provide better data when some context is available.  ExecuteOrderRules help with this in that they define the order in which a property is assigned when the model is being created.

For example, if a Person type exposes a Gender property then the FirstName property should ideally match that gender. The DefaultBuildStrategy supports this by defining that the GenderValueGenerator gets executed before the FirstNameValueGenerator which is executed before the StringValueGenerator. Another example of this is that the DefaultBuildStrategy defines the enum properties will be assigned before other property types because they tend to be reference data that might define how other properties are assigned.

### Constructor resolver

The constructor resolver is used to assist in resolving the constructor to execute when creating child instances of a model in the DefaultExecuteStrategy&lt;T&gt;. This supports a scenario where a property type to create is a type that does not have a default constructor and no parameters are available to create with. The constructor resolver will guess which is the most appropriate constructor to use for which the execute strategy will then create the required parameters.
